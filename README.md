Templates that I use for performing with Ableton Live

Session Song Template

This template is the one I use for incorporating tracks using an audio interface.
Utilizing _Sends_ and _Returns_, I can assign groups of tracks to always route through the same outputs whenever transfering between computers to edit or perform.
