Ableton Live Templates

Templates that I use for performing with Ableton Live

Session Song Template
----
This template is the one I use for incorporating tracks using an audio interface.
Utilizing _Sends_ and _Returns_, I can assign groups of tracks to always route through the same outputs whenever transfering between computers to edit or perform.

LSC Worship Template
----
This template is the one I use for weekend worship sets.
Utilizing tracks built in the above mentioned _Session Song Template_, we can easily drag and drop tracks into the worship set template to create a full worship set within minutes, rather than slaving over the set for hours every week.
It usually takes 1-2 hours to convert a MultiTracks.comÂ® project into the _Session Song Template_.
Once the song is converted, it's as simple as dragging and dropping into the worship set.
